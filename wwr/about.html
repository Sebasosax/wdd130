            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Down the River was founded in 2010 by a group of friends passionate about nature and rafting in Costa Rica who wanted to share their passion with more people. Their adventure began by exploring lesser-known rivers, and over time, they perfected their routes and services to provide the best possible experience.
                   Thanks to the dedication of a committed team and expert guides, the company has steadily grown, becoming a trusted choice for those seeking to experience the thrill of rafting and connect with nature in a safe and responsible way.
                   We offer a wide variety of rafting activities, supported by staff who are dedicated to their work and genuinely care about their customers, ensuring they have a fun time, stay safe, and learn from this unique experience that Down the River can provide.</p>
